## GLM Documentation {.unnumbered}

For GLM technical documentation, visit the [glm-aed](https://github.com/AquaticEcoDynamics/glm-aed/wiki) GitHub Repository wiki. For a detailed scientific overview of GLM, refer to @hipsey2019general's paper available [here](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/473/2019/gmd-12-473-2019.pdf).

## Tools You'll Need {.unnumbered}

### Text Editor {.unnumbered}

A text editor is required to edit GLM's `.nml` configuration files. Simple text editors like *TextEdit* on MacOS or *Wordpad* on Windows can be used however more extensible editors like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io) are recommended. To edit the `.nml` file, simply right click on the file and open it in your preferred text editor. Changes to the file must be saved before running GLM.

### Excel {.unnumbered}

GLM can read and write data in CSV format. Excel can be used to edit these files (e.g. time series meteorological input data) or plotting outputs.

### R {.unnumbered}

Similarly to Excel, R can be used to manipulate and visualise GLM's inputted/outputted dated.

## Unzipping files {.unnumbered}

The GLM model and case study simulations featured in this workbook are distributed as a zipped file. Extracting these files will depend on your operating system.

On MacOS, simply double click the 'zipped' file:

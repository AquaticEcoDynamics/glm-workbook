#### Running GLM on MacOS {#C02_4 -}

- Open the Terminal application on your Mac
- Use the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the simulation directory (e.g. the *WarmLake* folder)
- In Finder, go to the `GLM/mac` folder and right-click on the glm app, select *Show Package Contents*
- Enter the Contents folder then the MacOS folder, and locate the glm executable file
- Back in terminal, enter the file path for this executable file - you can do this by dragging/dropping the file into the terminal
- Leave a space after the file path and type `--xdisp`
- Press `Enter` and the model will run

These steps are shown in the screen recording below for an example simulation:

  <source src="images/09-module8/video1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center>

```{block2, hint03_1, type='rmdnote2'}
Your Mac may block opening GLM the first time you run it. If this occurs, go to your Security options inside System Preferences and click 'Open Anyway'.
```

#### Running GLM on Windows {#C02_5 -}

On Windows, the model can be run using a batch-file `glm.bat`, which you can open from in the simulation directory (e.g. *Kinneret97* folder). The `.bat` file calls the GLM model from the current working directory, and should be located where the `glm.nml' file is.


``` {fortran, eval = FALSE, style="max-height: 239px;"}
..\GLM\win\glm_3.3.0\glm.exe --xdisp
echo press any key
pause
```


```{block2, hint03_2, type='rmdnote2'}

If the model is not opening make sure that you are **not** working from a network directory (e.g. OneDrive) and the file path to the `glm.bat` file has **zero** spaces in it.

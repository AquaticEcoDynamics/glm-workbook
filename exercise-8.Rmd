# Changing Morphometry 

Edit the heights and areas of the lake using `&morphometry`: `H` and `A`. Remember that the first area must be 0 m^2^ and that all of the heights and areas must be increasing. Create a very steep-sided lake or a very shallow lake. Compare the degree of stratification with your original simulation.

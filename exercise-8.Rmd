# Changing Morphometry

The lake shape will influence the water balance and pattern of vertical stratification. The lake's shape in GLM is resolved using a *hypsographic curve* - that is the relationship between height and wetted area. This is captured in the `glm.nml` `&morphometry` section.

Edit the heights and areas of the lake using `&morphometry`: `H` and `A`. Remember that the first area must be 0 m^2^ and that all of the heights and areas must be monotonically increasing. Create a very steep-sided lake or a very shallow lake. Compare the degree of stratification with your original simulation.

You should already feel confident using Excel from your previous units, however if you need further guidance please visit UWA’s LinkedIn Learning resources. R To get started with R, first download the base R system onto your computer. By itself, this provides a rudimentary console for interacting with the R programming language. For a more user-friendly experience, download the R Studio integrated development environment (IDE). R can be downloaded here R Studio can be downloaded here Terminology File types In this unit you will largely be dealing with two kinds of ‘R files’: R script files (e.g. Equations.R) and, R project files (e.g. Module2Biogeochem.Rproj) R scripts are the raw instructions that tell the R programming language what to do. Meanwhile, an R Project file simply creates an independent workplace environment for you to interact with and manage your scripts. It’s wise to create a new R Project file whenever you start working on a new project. Functions and packages Just like Excel, you can interact with your data using a variety of functions in R. Functions are the tools you use to get the job done. For example, the plot() function can be used to create graphs. R is an open source programming language, meaning anyone can create their own functions and bundle them up in a collection known as a package. Comments All programming languages allow the user to write comments on their code to assist in readability and structure. In R, a comment is defined as a line beginning with a #. Any characters written after the # are ignored by R and not executed. It’s good practice to get into the habit of commenting your R code as it will likely save you (or someone else!) a lot of time later down the track. # This is a comment! # Create a graph using the plot() function plot(my_data,variable1,col=&quot;red&quot;,ylab=&quot;My y-axis label&quot;) # Plot other variables onto the graph using the points() function points(my_data,variable2,col=&quot;blue&quot;) points(my_data,variable3,col=&quot;green&quot;) points(my_data,variable4,col=&quot;purple&quot;) To comment multiple lines of code at once in R Studio, pressCommand + Shift + Con MacOS orControl + Shift + Con Windows Further R resources Read the Introduction to R and Statistics book for a more detailed coverage on the core data visualisation and statistics capabilities in R Access UWA’s LinkedIn Learning portal the learn more about the basics of R Refer to some handy R cheatsheets R Studio cheatsheet ggplot2 data visualisation cheatsheet Unzipping files Many of the module resources found in this workbook are downloaded as ‘zipped’ (i.e. compressed) files. ‘Unzipping’ (i.e. extracting) these files is simple. On MacOS, simply double click the ‘zipped’ file: On Windows, click ‘Extract All’ and follow the prompt: "],["glm-file-structure.html", "GLM File Structure", " GLM File Structure "],["running-glm.html", "Running GLM", " Running GLM Running GLM on MacOS Open the Terminal application on your Mac Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the Kinneret97 folder In Finder, go to the macGLM folder and right-click on the glm app, select Show Package Contents Enter the Contents folder then the MacOS folder, and locate the glm executable file Back in terminal, enter the file path for this executable file - you can do this by dragging/dropping the file into the terminal Leave a space after the file path and type --xdisp Press Enter and the model will open Your Mac may block opening GLM the first time you run it. If this occurs, go to your Security options inside System Preferences and click ‘Open Anyway’. Running GLM on Windows On Windows, the model can be run using a batch-file glm.bat, which you can double click from in the Kinneret97 directory. The .bat file calls the GLM model from the current working directory. If the model is not opening make sure you’re not working in a network directory (e.g. OneDrive) and the file path to the glm.bat file has zero spaces in it.

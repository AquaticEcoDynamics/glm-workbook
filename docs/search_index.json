Simple text editors like TextEdit on MacOS or Wordpad on Windows can be used however more extensible editors like Visual Studio Code or Atom are recommended. To edit the .nml file, simply right click on the file and open it in your preferred text editor. Changes to the file must be saved before running GLM. Excel GLM can read and write data in CSV format. Excel can be used to edit these files (e.g. time series meteorological input data) or plotting outputs. R Similarly to Excel, R can be used to manipulate and visualise GLM’s inputted/outputted dated. R can be downloaded here R Studio can be downloaded here Unzipping files The GLM model and case study simulations featured in this workbook are distributed as a zipped file. Extracting these files will depend on your operating system. On MacOS, simply double click the ‘zipped’ file: On Windows, click ‘Extract All’ and follow the prompt: "],["glm-file-structure.html", "GLM File Structure", " GLM File Structure "],["running-glm.html", "Running GLM", " Running GLM Running GLM on MacOS Open the Terminal application on your Mac Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the simulation directory (e.g. the Kinneret97 folder) In Finder, go to the macGLM folder and right-click on the glm app, select Show Package Contents Enter the Contents folder then the MacOS folder, and locate the glm executable file Back in terminal, enter the file path for this executable file - you can do this by dragging/dropping the file into the terminal Leave a space after the file path and type --xdisp Press Enter and the model will run These steps are shown in the screen recording below for the Kinneret97 simulation: Your Mac may block opening GLM the first time you run it. If this occurs, go to your Security options inside System Preferences and click ‘Open Anyway’. Running GLM on Windows On Windows, the model can be run using a batch-file glm.bat, which you can open from in the simulation directory (e.g. Kinneret97 folder). The .bat file calls the GLM model from the current working directory. If the model is not opening make sure you’re not working in a network directory (e.g. OneDrive) and the file path to the glm.bat file has zero spaces in it.

It is calculated by summing the absolute error between paired values (i.e. modeled and actual) and dividing by the number of observations: \\[\\begin{equation} MAE = \\frac{\\sum_{i}\\left | T_{i}^{sim}-T_{i}^{obs} \\right |}{n} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] Sensitivity Index (SI) Calculating a sensitivity index allows the impact of changing an independent variable to be assessed on a dependent variable. Given all other variables are held constant, the SI is computed by dividing the percentage change in the simulated result (i.e. the output) by the percentage change of the input parameter: \\[\\begin{equation} SI = \\frac{(Output_{new}-Output_{original})/Output_{original}}{(Parameter_{new}-Parameter_{original})/Parameter_{original}} \\tag{2} \\end{equation}\\] "],["kinneret-sim.html", "Case Study: Kinneret Error Assessment", " Case Study: Kinneret The Kinneret97 model simulation above has the ecological model aed2 enabled. It has been pre- configured to run the customizable AED modules. These are separate models, but have been set up to run side by side. They are configured using the text file aed2.nml. The above simulation was only plotting temperature and salinity and these plots were configured in plots.nml. Open plots.nml to see how you can customise the graphs. There are many other variables we may be interested in plotting when we run the watter quality model such as oxygen, nutrients, and algae. A pre-configured file called plots_aed2.nml has been created. To use this file, rename it to plots.nml (you’ll first need to rename the existing plots.nml) and run the model. You should now see more outputs for the lake simulation. In plots.nml the required variables are all listed, make sure the number of plots is high enough to include them all. Table 1: Water quality variables and their descriptions.

To do so we must edit the output section of the glm3.nml file, by adding the variables as extra columns to the .csv file that were configured above. If they are there already, make sure that the number of variables is high enough to include them all. ol > li > ol > li {list-style-type:lower-alpha} As an example to output water quality variables, let’s plot all the nitrogen variables. Change csv_point_vars to include NIT_amm, NIT_nit, OGM_don, OGM_pon, PHY_green_IN - these are all the variables that contribute to the total nitrogen (TN) pool. Now re-run the model (e.g. Windows users double clicking glm.bat again). Once it’s run open WQ_35.csv to see these new variables and create a stacked area plot to show how the different variables contribute to TN. Create a well formatted, interesting graph of variables of your choice (for example, you may like to consider all of the phytoplankton groups or create sums of these to generate a NPZD model) to see how they interact and change over time. If any variables are much bigger or smaller than the others, then use two y-axes or multiple plots. How would these concentrations change if the air temperature increased by 2°C? (You will need to edit the met_hourly.csv file). Make sure to save with correct date format, taking note these met measurements are recorded hourly, so YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm. A pre-made version of this file can be found in bcs which is called met_1997_2004_airT2.csv. To use this file, update meteo_fl = 'bcs/met_1997_2004.csv' in the &amp;meteorology section of glm3.nml. .codeScroll { overflow-y: scroll; height:450px; } !------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ! meteorology !------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;meteorology met_sw = .true. lw_type = &#39;LW_IN&#39; rain_sw = .false. atm_stab = 0 fetch_mode = 0 !rad_mode = 1 albedo_mode = 1 cloud_mode = 4 !-- BC file details subdaily = .true. meteo_fl = &#39;bcs/met_1997_2004.csv&#39; !&lt;------- Update this wind_factor = 0.9 lw_factor = 1.0 lw_offset = 0.0 !-- Parameters ce = 0.0013 ch = 0.0013 cd = 0.0013 !catchrain = .true. !rain_threshold = 0.001 !runoff_coef = 0.0 / What happens if we change the water clarity? Increase and decrease from the original value to see the response You must change the light extinction coefficient Kw (range 0-1) in the glm3.nml file. Error Assessment Calculate the mean absolute error in the simulation using the observed temperature data (ObservedTempData.xlsx from the data folder in Kinneret97) and the simulated temperature data (the simulated temperature data is from the surface layer in lake.csv). ol > li > ol > li {list-style-type:lower-alpha} Calculate the sensitivity of the modelled temperature to changes in water clarity (the light extinction coefficient, \\(K_w\\)) and wind speed (wind_factor). These can be found in glm3.nml. Try increasing and decreasing the default parameter value by 0.2 and see how much the output changes.

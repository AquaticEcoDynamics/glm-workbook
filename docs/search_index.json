Simple text editors like TextEdit on MacOS or Wordpad on Windows can be used however more extensible editors like Visual Studio Code, UltraEdit or Atom are recommended. To edit the .nml file, simply right click on the file and open it in your preferred text editor. Changes to the file must be saved before running GLM. Excel GLM reads and writes data in CSV format. Excel can be used to edit these files (e.g. time series meteorological input data) or for plotting outputs. R R is also commonly used to manipulate and visualise GLM’s input/output data. R can be downloaded here R Studio can be downloaded here Case-study download The GLM model and two case-study simulations setup for the below exercises are available for download by clicking the download button in the tool bar . The simulation in the WarmLake directory is an example 40m deep, monomictic lake that is used to supply drinking water and support an active fishery. The simulation in the TropicalReservoir directory is a typical water supply reservoir (drowned river valley) located in a sub-tropical climate. This simulation is polymictic, mixing variably throughout the year. Other model simulations are also available in the glm-aed GitHub repository in glm-examples directory. Unzipping files The GLM model and case study simulations featured in this workbook are distributed as a zipped file. In some cases users may erroneously be working “within” the zip without properly extracting the file and this prevents the simulation from running. Extracting these files will depend on your operating system.

The key elements of this file are depicted as ‘blocks’ and each block of configuration options and parameters is summarised in detail on this page. Each block is started with an ampersand &amp; and finished with a slash /. The blocks contain text that can be either - single parameters (with units) - listed parameters, for example, for every depth layer or every river inflow - listed variables, for example, variables to be read in or written to the output - file paths and file names - configuration switches (integers or logical values) Some key inputs for setting up a GLM simulation are listed below. &amp;wq_setup:wq_lib sets an external water quality model, for example, ‘aed’. &amp;wq_setup:wq_nml_file is the filepath and filename for an external water quality model namelist. &amp;glm_morphometry:H is a list of some of the heights of the lake. &amp;glm_morphometry:A is a list of some of the areas of the lake, at the same layers listed in H. &amp;time:timefmt is a switch for the time setup: either number of days (= 3) or start and stop days (= 2). &amp;time:start and stop are the dates to start and stop (timefmt = 2). &amp;time:num_days is the number of days for a simulation (timefmt = 3). &amp;output:csv_point_nlevs is the number of csv_point_at depths to use, as listed left to right. &amp;output:csv_point_at is a list of the depths (m) from the bottom at which an output csv file is written. &amp;output:csv_point_vars is a list of the simulated variables to write to the output csv. &amp;output:csv_point_nvars is the number of csv_point_vars to use, as listed left to right. If a csv_point_at depth is listed but it is greater than the initial depth of the lake, no initial value can be written and the model will not work. &amp;init_profiles:num_depths is the number (integer) of depths to set for the initial profile. &amp;init_profiles:the_depths are the depths (m) of the initial profiles, where other features are configured, from bottom to top. &amp;init_profiles:the_temps are the initial temperatures at the_depths. &amp;init_profiles:the_sals are the initial salinity at the_depths. &amp;inflow:num_inflows is a number (integer) of inflowing streams. &amp;inflow:inflow_fl is a list of the file names for the inflowing streams. &amp;inflow:inflow_vars is a list of variables to be taken from the inflow files. &amp;outflow:num_outlet is a number (integer) of outflowing streams. &amp;outflow:outflow_fl is a list of the file names for the outflowing streams. &amp;outflow:outflow_fl is a list of the file names for the outflowing streams. GLM plot window file: plots.nml The plots.nml text file configures the automatic plot window that runs during the simulation. The x axis is time, the y axis is lake depth layer and the z axis (colour bar) is the scale of the variable, for example concentration. The user can configure the plot window using the following: - &amp;plots_window:width and height set the dimensions of the plotting window (mm). - &amp;plots:plot_width and plot_height set the dimensions of the individual plots (mm). - &amp;plots:title is a list of the titles displayed above each plot. - &amp;plots:vars is a list of the GLM or AED variables for each plot, in the same sequence as title. - &amp;plots:min_z and max_z set the minimum and maximum values for each of the variables, in the same sequence as title. Boundary files Boundary .csv files can be found in the ‘inputs’ directory. The exact names and paths are listed in the glm3.nml block &amp;inflow, &amp;outflow and &amp;meteorology. Inflow files The simulated lake may have streams or rivers flowing into it. If so, one time series boundary .csv file is used for each inflow stream. The rows of the csv are time steps and the columns are inflowing variables, such as flow volume, salinity and oxygen. The file names are listed in inflow_fl and the model will read them in from left to right according to the number set in num_inflows. Outflow files In a similar way to the inflow files, the simulated lake may have streams or rivers flowing out of it. If so, one time series boundary .csv file is used for each outflow stream. The rows of the csv are time steps and the columns are outflowing variables, such as flow volume, salinity and oxygen. The file names are listed in outflow_fl and the model will read them in from left to right according to the number set in num_outlet. Meteorological file One meteorological file sets conditions at the surface of the lake, i.e. the water-atmosphere boundary. It includes values such as air temperature, wind speed and light. The file is also a time-series boundary, with rows as time steps and columns as each boundary variable. It often has a name like ‘met.csv’. AED water quality model files If an external water quality model is being used, it will be specified with the parameter &amp;wq_setup: wq_lib, for example, ‘aed’. The parameters for the water quality model are specified by a file and file path in wq_nml_file, for example, ‘aed/aed.nml’. GLM output files Once GLM is running, it will write its results to several different output files. Output Netcdf The results of all variables at all time steps and depths are written to the netcdf file. This file may have a size of hundreds of MB or GB. The file can be accessed with Matlab or R packages that have been created to organize these large file types. General lake .csv One csv is written for each simulation. The file name is set with the parameter &amp;output: csv_lake_fname, for example ‘lake.csv’. This file contains values that apply to the whole lake, such as lake volume, lake level and surface temperature. If this file is open in a program such as Excel, the GLM program cannot overwrite the file. Close the .csv or save it with a different file name before running the model again. A list of the variables contained in the lake .csv can be found here. The table ‘2D variables from lake.csv’ lists the variables, a description and the units of each. This .csv is especially useful for calculating the water balance and heat balance of the lake. Depth-specific .csv Profiles can be output at specified depths, using &amp;output: csv_point_fname and csv_point_at. For example, if csv_point_fname is ‘WQ’ and csv_point_at is 1, 5, 12, then the model will create files ‘WQ_1’, ‘WQ_5’ and ‘WQ_12’. The variables for this file are listed in the parameter csv_point_vars. This file can be used to access output data at one depth more easily than via the netcdf file.

If this occurs, go to your Security options inside System Preferences and click ‘Open Anyway’. Running GLM on Windows On Windows, the model can be run using a batch-file glm.bat, which you can open from in the simulation directory (e.g. Kinneret97 folder).

Copy the water balance columns from lake.csv to your own spreadsheet. Calculate the total water balance in a new column. You can find the list of the variables on this page. Plot the lake water balance – volume, water level and fluxes including inflows, outflows, rainfall and evaporation. Remember to label all the variables and units that you plot.

Save the data in lake.csv as a new xls spreadsheet. Plot the surface heat fluxes and the total energy balance over time. Set the axes so that the incoming energy fluxes are positive and outgoing are negative; a stacked area plot is often a useful way to summarise. 2.2 Lake Stratification A lake is ‘stratified’ if it has a large difference between the top and bottom for a variable such as temperature or salinity. Stratification is usually created by sunlight making surface water warm and buoyant. Wind events and prolonged periods of surface cooling lead to mixing and can break the stratification. GLM uses many layers to resolve the vertical temperature and salinity profiles over the water column depth. Inspect the depth-time contour plots in the GLM plotting window to examine the nature of stratification in the case study simulation(s). Do you see any seasonal patterns in the temperature differences between the top and the bottom? Is this reflected in any variables other than temperature? Outputing variables at multiple depths: We can configure GLM to look in more depth the nature of differences between the upper and lower layers. Go to the &amp;output (not &amp;outflow!) section of glm3.nml and customize the configuration to make two depth-specific output files, one at 5 m from the bottom (ie. in the lake hypolimnion) and one at 35 m from the bottom (i.e. in the lake epilimnion). Use the parameter csv_point_at to set the depths, from the bottom, at which the model will write .csv files. This will create two .csv files (WQ_5.csv and WQ_35.csv) with conditions at these water depths. !------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ! format for output and filename(s) !------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;output out_dir = &#39;output&#39; out_fn = &#39;output&#39; nsave = 24 !

Find the new output .csv files in the output folder. Copy the data to a new Excel spreadsheet. Calculate the temperature difference between the top and the bottom. Identify the time periods where the lake is stratified and mixed. If an output file is open in Excel, the GLM program cannot overwrite the file. Close the .csv or save it with a different file name before running the model again. "],["updating-initial-height-conditions.html", "3 Updating Initial Height Conditions", " 3 Updating Initial Height Conditions The height of the water in the lake at the first time step is set in &amp;init_profiles: lake_depth. Consider this: what would happen if all the environmental boundary conditions were the same, but the initial storage were half as much? Decrease your lake_depth to 50% of the value you started with. Examine the results in the GLM plotting window and compare them to the original simulation. Create an output profile just below the surface. For example, if your initial height is 21 m, create csv_point_at files at 5 m and 18 m from the bottom. Calculate the temperature difference between the top and the bottom, as in the previous exercise. Describe the effect on stratification of having a shallower lake. If a csv_point_at depth is listed but it is greater than the initial depth of the lake, no initial value can be written and the model will not work. For future activities make sure you change back to the original height. "],["error-assessment.html", "4 Error Assessment Mean Absolute Error (MAE)", " 4 Error Assessment Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Mean absolute error measures the average absolute difference between the simulated and the observed results.

Both the WarmLake and TropicalReservoir case-studies have the AED model pre-configured. A schematic (conceptual model) of the interactions being simulated are shown below. Activate the water quality AED modules by making sure the &amp;wq_setup block is ready and uncommented, and the wq_lib = ‘aed’ entry is set. Make sure glm3.nml can find another namelist file aed.nml to configure the water quality model parameters, using the &amp;wq_setup parameter wq_nml_file. The above simulation was only plotting temperature and salinity and these plots were configured in plots.nml. Open plots.nml to see how you can customise the graphs. There are many other variables we may be interested in plotting when we run the watter quality model such as oxygen, nutrients, and algae. A pre-configured file called plots_aed.nml has been created. To use this file, rename it to plots.nml (you’ll first need to rename the existing plots.nml) and run the model. You should now see more outputs for the lake simulation.

Now re-run the model (e.g. Windows users double clicking glm.bat again). Once it’s run open WQ_35.csv to see these new variables and create a stacked area plot to show how the different variables contribute to TN. Create a well formatted, interesting graph of variables of your choice (for example, you may like to consider all of the phytoplankton groups or create sums of these to generate a NPZD model) to see how they interact and change over time. If any variables are much bigger or smaller than the others, then use two y-axes or multiple plots. "],["sensitivity-index-si.html", "6 Sensitivity Index (SI)", " 6 Sensitivity Index (SI) Calculating a sensitivity index allows the impact of changing an independent variable to be assessed on a dependent variable. Another way to think of this is how much does an output change if I change an input? Given all other variables are held constant, the SI is computed by dividing the percentage change in the simulated result (i.e. the output) by the percentage change of the input parameter: \\[\\begin{equation} SI = \\frac{(Output_{new}-Output_{original})/Output_{original}}{(Parameter_{new}-Parameter_{original})/Parameter_{original}} \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] If there is a large change in the output variable, we say that the variable is sensitive to the parameter. If there is a small change in the output variable, we say the variable is not sensitive to the parameter. Calculate the sensitivity of the modelled temperature to changes in water clarity (the light extinction coefficient, \\(K_w\\)) and wind speed (wind_factor). These can be found in glm3.nml: &amp;light and &amp;meteorology. Try increasing and decreasing the default parameter value by 0.2 and see how much the output changes.

The file glm3.nml has several key sections in it related to the model domain and parameters, the sources of boundary condition data, and details of outputs.

The lake has a surface area of 173 km2, and is about 49 m deep. The model is set-up to simulate the hydrological domain of Lake Kinneret for 2 years, from 1997-01-01 to 1999-01-01 (&amp;time), with water balance and heat fluxes hypothetically calculated based on the lake configuration and input data. Water quality functionality (AED2) is disabled for the simulation (&amp;wq_setup). The Kinneret97 model simulation above has the ecological model aed2 enabled. It has been pre-configured to run the customizable AED modules. These are separate models, but have been set up to run side by side. They are configured using the text file aed2.nml. Exercises Begin by running the model as-is. If you’re not sure how to do this, read the Getting Started page. This simulation was only plotting temperature and salinity and these plots were configured in plots.nml. Open plots.nml to see how you can customise the graphs. There are many other variables we may be interested in plotting when we run the watter quality model such as oxygen, nutrients, and algae. A pre-configured file called plots_aed2.nml has been created. To use this file, rename it to plots.nml (you’ll first need to rename the existing plots.nml) and run the model. You should now see more outputs for the lake simulation. In plots.nml the required variables are all listed, make sure the number of plots is high enough to include them all. Table 8.2: Water quality variables and their descriptions.

To do so we must edit the output section of the glm3.nml file, by adding the variables as extra columns to the .csv file that were configured above. If they are there already, make sure that the number of variables is high enough to include them all. ol > li > ol > li {list-style-type:lower-alpha} As an example to output water quality variables, let’s plot all the nitrogen variables. Change csv_point_vars to include NIT_amm, NIT_nit, OGM_don, OGM_pon, PHY_green_IN - these are all the variables that contribute to the total nitrogen (TN) pool. Now re-run the model (e.g. Windows users double clicking glm.bat again). Once it’s run open WQ_35.csv to see these new variables and create a stacked area plot to show how the different variables contribute to TN. Create a well formatted, interesting graph of variables of your choice (for example, you may like to consider all of the phytoplankton groups or create sums of these to generate a NPZD model) to see how they interact and change over time. If any variables are much bigger or smaller than the others, then use two y-axes or multiple plots. How would these concentrations change if the air temperature increased by 2°C? (You will need to edit the met_hourly.csv file). Make sure to save with correct date format, taking note these met measurements are recorded hourly, so YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm. A pre-made version of this file can be found in bcs which is called met_1997_2004_airT2.csv.

The dam can hold up to 259,000 megalitres of water and is the major source for the city of Darwin. The reservoir is located approximately 50 km south of Darwin and was Completed in 1972. In response to the growing population and industrial activities of the area, the spillway and reservoir wall were raised by 1.3 m in 2010 to increase the yield of the reservoir. The DRR GLM model was built to assess risks associated with hydro-climatological variability and operational decisions.
